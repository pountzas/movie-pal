2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement image caching and background sync
3. **UI Polish**: Add animations and micro-interactions
4. **Loading Skeletons**: Implement proper loading states

### Recently Completed ✅

- **Theme Toggle Bug Fixed**: Notification bar icons now update correctly on app launch
- **Cast Implementation**: Added cast information to movie detail view
- **Test Files Prepared**: Comprehensive test structure for 4 components created
- **Jest Configuration**: Testing framework setup with TypeScript support
- **Code Quality**: Clean test code with proper error handling
- **OTA Update Fix**: Resolved app crashes from update errors

### On Hold ⏳

- **Automated Testing**: Test execution paused due to React 19.1.0 ecosystem compatibility issues

### Medium-term Goals

1. **⏳ ON HOLD: Testing Suite**: Test files prepared, awaiting React 19.1.0 ecosystem support
2. **Advanced Features**: Watchlists, favorites, advanced filtering
3. **User Authentication**: Personalized recommendations and sync
