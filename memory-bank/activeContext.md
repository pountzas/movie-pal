- **Jest Configuration**: Modern testing framework setup with TypeScript support
- **Test Environment**: Proper mocks and setup for Expo/React Native components
- **OTA Update Fix**: Resolved app crashes from update errors

### On Hold ⏳

- **Automated Testing**: Complete testing infrastructure implemented but execution blocked by React 19.1.0 ecosystem compatibility issues

### Medium-term Goals

1. **⏳ ON HOLD: Testing Suite**: Complete infrastructure ready, awaiting React 19.1.0 ecosystem compatibility fixes
2. **React 19 Testing Compatibility**: Resolve ecosystem issues or implement React 18 testing environment
3. **Advanced Features**: Watchlists, favorites, advanced filtering
4. **User Authentication**: Personalized recommendations and sync
5. **Push Notifications**: Release updates and recommendations

### Long-term Vision

1. **Social Features**: Movie sharing, user reviews, community features
2. **Offline Video**: Download trailers for offline viewing
3. **Cross-device Sync**: Sync watchlists across devices
4. **Advanced Search**: Voice search, image search, recommendation engine

## Current Technical Debt

- No automated testing infrastructure
- Limited error boundary implementation
- Basic performance optimizations only
- Hardcoded API endpoints and configuration
- No code splitting or lazy loading
