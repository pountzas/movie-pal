- ✅ TMDb API integration for movie data
- ✅ Zustand state management with AsyncStorage persistence
- ✅ Nativewind styling with dark mode support
- ✅ Search functionality with real-time results
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android/Web)

## Current State Assessment

### Working Features

- **Movie Dashboard**: Infinite scroll of popular movies
- **Search**: Real-time movie search by title
- **Offline Support**: Cached data persists between sessions
- **Dark Mode**: Theme switching with system preference detection
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Known Issues

- **Theme Toggle Bug**: Notification bar icons don't update correctly on initial dark mode load (works after manual toggle)
- **Limited Movie Details**: Basic information only, missing cast/crew, ratings, reviews
- **Performance**: No advanced optimizations (image caching, background sync)
- **Testing**: No automated tests implemented
- **✅ FIXED: OTA Update Error**: App was crashing on "Failed to download remote update" error

## Active Development Focus

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix Theme Toggle Bug**: Ensure notification bar icons update correctly on app launch
2. **Enhanced Movie Details**: Add cast, crew, ratings, and reviews to detail view
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement image caching and background sync
4. **UI Polish**: Add animations and micro-interactions

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Testing Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
2. **Advanced Features**: Watchlists, favorites, advanced filtering
3. **User Authentication**: Personalized recommendations and sync
4. **Push Notifications**: Release updates and recommendations

### Long-term Vision

1. **Social Features**: Movie sharing, user reviews, community features
2. **Offline Video**: Download trailers for offline viewing
3. **Cross-device Sync**: Sync watchlists across devices
4. **Advanced Search**: Voice search, image search, recommendation engine

## Current Technical Debt

- No automated testing infrastructure
- Limited error boundary implementation
- Basic performance optimizations only
- Hardcoded API endpoints and configuration
- No code splitting or lazy loading
