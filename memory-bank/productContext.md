# Product Context

## Why MoviePal Exists

MoviePal addresses the need for a simple, reliable mobile app for movie discovery that works offline and provides a clean user experience. In an era where streaming services dominate entertainment choices, users need quick access to movie information without relying on constant internet connectivity.
